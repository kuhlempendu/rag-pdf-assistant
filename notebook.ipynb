The main aim of this article is to \\nemphasize on research ethics. Knowledge in characteristics, \\nimportance and objectives of research motivate to be ethical in \\nresearch. It is the utmost importance knowing these three basic \\nsubjects of research for researchers specially for novice \\nresearchers. These improve research mentality, academic attitude \\nand way of thinking that enable researcher to choose research area, \\ngenerate constructive potential research title. In addition, motivate \\nto know what the problem is and cause of problem and how to \\nsolve the recognized valid problem. In fact, an outstanding unique \\ncontribution of a research depends on applying research ethics. A \\nprofound understanding the (CIO) of research reinforce research \\nmotive and enable to follow research ethics that is core \\nrequirement in each research activities.  \\n \\nIndex Terms- characteristics of research, importance of research, \\nobjectives of research, research  problem, research ethics, basic \\nresearch, applied research. \\n \\nI.

It educates and monitors as well as enables responsible \\nscientists to confirm a high ethical standard in conducting \\nresearch13. It is worthwhile mentioning that the research ethics is \\na key part of advanced academic learning in all academic \\ndisciplines, as it prevents different forms of misconduct and \\nfraud14. Therefore, scientists have become increasingly aware of \\nthe importance of ethics in research and have contributed a great \\nlot towards ethics discourse15. \\n         There are at least two major dimensions of ethics in  all \\nresearch. These are (a) procedural ethics, which usually involves \\nseeking approval from a relevant ethics committee to undertake \\nresearch involving humans; and (b) “ethics in practice” or the \\neveryday ethical issues that arise in the doing of research. It could \\nbe argued that there is another dimension —research ethics as \\narticulated in professional codes of ethics or conduct. Most \\nprofessions and organizations have professional codes of conduct \\n(Bulmer,1982;16 Coady & Bloch, 1996;17 Homan, 1991)18. \\n         In fact, truth and trustworthy results are ‘flesh and bones’ of \\nscientific research. To have trustworthy results and to avoid \\nmisconduct, researchers should use optimal study designs and \\nfollow ethical standards 19. In the fight against intellectual  \\ndishonesty on ethics education in science has a significant place. \\nA general understanding of ethics in scientific research work in all \\nits stages had to be acquired during the undergraduate course 20. \\nDefinitely, the main motivation of research ethics is C IO; it is a \\nbasis of all other structures, frameworks and ethical paradigm of \\nresearch.

Hudson Maxim31 (1853-1927) said “All \\nprogress is born of inquiry 32. Doubt is often better than \\noverconfidence, for it leads to inquiry, and inquiry leads to \\ninvention”. Increased amounts of research make progress \\npossible33. Research is significant both in scientific and non -\\nscientific fields34. Research is important for the following reasons:  \\n(1) A research problem refers to a complexity which a researcher \\nor a scientific community or an industry or a government \\norganisation or a society experiences.

Though each research study \\nhas its own specific purpose, we may think of research objectives \\nmight be into a number of vital objectives44. For example,  (1) To \\nportray accurately the characteristics of a particular individual, \\nsituation or a group (studies with this object in view are known as \\ndescriptive research studies) 45. (2) To determine the frequency \\nwith which something occurs or with which it is associated with \\nsomething else (studies with this object in view are known as \\ndiagnostic research studies)46. (3) To test a hypothesis of a causal \\nrelationship between variables  (such studies are known as \\nhypothesis-testing research studies)47. (4) To understand clearly an \\nobserved phenomenon and explain its logic and reason for \\nhappening. (5) To get insights about problem. (6) To find solutions \\nfor a problem. (7) To test existing laws or theories. (8) To develop \\nnew ideas, concepts and theories. (9) To identify areas where \\nresearch could make the difference. (10) To predict future of \\nevents48. Additionally,  (11) To interpret  theory. (12) To develop \\nresearch methodology from the d ivine perspective. (13) To \\ninterpret the divine knowledge (14) To derive philosophy, \\nprinciple and solution of problem from the Holy Qur’an (15) To \\nunderstand the truth and reality. (16) To know the sciences (17) \\nTo know the divine creativities  in Creatio n. (18) To appropriate \\nmanagement of resources. (19) To establish human and \\nenvironment friendly society. (20) To know the Creator. (21) To \\nknow the purpose of human life. (22) To know how to protect \\nhuman life from astray. (23) To arrange acceptable answer of valid \\nresearch questions. (24) To extend dimensions of beneficial \\nknowledge. (25) To identify the research gap in basic research. \\n(26) To recognize the research problem in applied research. (27) \\nTo arrest the causes of problem. (28) To examine past re search \\nworks.  \\n         These objectives are a summary of meaning and definition \\nof research. From these objectives one more or two more or three \\nmore objectives could be in a research. It is not a mandatory must \\nbe only an objective or one more objectives in a research.
